            With over a decade of experience in software development, I bring expertise in both traditional 
            server-based applications and modern cloud architecture. Currently serving as a Senior Engineer 
            at Maki, I focus on modernizing cloud-based solutions and lead development efforts for the 
            TeamRise product. I maintain an active technical blog covering software development topics in 
            both English and Japanese, demonstrating my commitment to sharing knowledge and fostering 
            technological advancement in both languages.
